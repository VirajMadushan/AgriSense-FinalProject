# AgriSense🌿

A Web-Based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring &amp; Control System


## 📘 Project Overview
AgriSense is a Web-Based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System that allows users to monitor environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light) and control actuators (irrigation, fan, and lighting) remotely using IoT technology. The system provides real-time data visualization, analytics, and alert notifications through a responsive web dashboard.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor real-time greenhouse conditions using IoT sensors.
- Control devices remotely via web interface.
- Store and visualize environmental data over time.
- Generate alerts when threshold limits are exceeded.
- Support multiple user roles (Admin, Operator).


## 🧩 Features

✅Real-time sensor data visualization

✅ Remote actuator control (fan, pump, lights)

✅ Historical data charts with date filters

✅ Threshold-based alerts (email/SMS)
