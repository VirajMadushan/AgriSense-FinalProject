# AgriSense🌿

A Web-Based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring &amp; Control System


## 📘 Project Overview
AgriSense is a Web-Based Smart Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System that allows users to monitor environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light) and control actuators (irrigation, fan, and lighting) remotely using IoT technology. The system provides real-time data visualization, analytics, and alert notifications through a responsive web dashboard.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor real-time greenhouse conditions using IoT sensors.
- Control devices remotely via web interface.
- Store and visualize environmental data over time.
- Generate alerts when threshold limits are exceeded.
- Support multiple user roles (Admin, Operator).


## 🧩 Features

✅Real-time sensor data visualization

✅ Remote actuator control (fan, pump, lights)

✅ Historical data charts with date filters

✅ Threshold-based alerts (email/SMS)




This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
